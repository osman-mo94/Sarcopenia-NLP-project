# Sarcopenia-NLP-project
This project aims to identify patients with Sarcopenia within the electronic healthcare record using NLP.

Saropenia is a condition that is defined by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and muscle weakness. It is is an age related condition that is associated with poor health outcomes such as falls, fractures, disability and hospitalisation. 

We hope to develop an NLP tool that can identify undiagnosed patients who are showing signs of muscle weakness. These patients can subsequently be further assessed by a clinician and have muscle strength testing. Patient's who subsequently are diagnosed with sarcopenia can then be referred for appropriate treatment.
