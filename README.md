# Sarcopenia-NLP-project

The code in this repository demonstates the use of NLP to identify terms related to Sarcopenia in clinic letters. This is a project that I am working on with the AGE Research Group at Newcastle University. Note that the letters used in this demonstration are synthetic and do not relate to real patients.

Saropenia is a condition that is defined by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and muscle weakness. It is is an age related condition that is associated with poor health outcomes such as falls, fractures, disability and hospitalisation. 

We hope to develop an NLP tool that can identify undiagnosed patients who are showing signs of muscle weakness. These patients can subsequently be further assessed by a clinician and have muscle strength testing. Patient's who subsequently are diagnosed with sarcopenia can then be referred for appropriate treatment. 

The tool that I am working on, builds on the work in this GitHub repository. I am using a collection of labelled discharge summaries to train a machine learning classifier to classify patients as 'Likely Sarcopenia' vs. 'Unlikely Sarcopenia'. I am not able to share this work due to the use of confidential patient information.
